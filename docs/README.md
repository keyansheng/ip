Rubber Duke is a rubber duck for debugging that also helps you manage your tasks with a fast command-line interface and beautiful graphical user interface.

> **If ducks are so smart, why donâ€™t we just let the ducks do all the work?** It would be wonderful if this were true, but the fact is that most ducks prefer to take a mentoring role. - https://rubberduckdebugging.com/
